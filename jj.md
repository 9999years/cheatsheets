# Workflows

- "Megamerge": <https://v5.chriskrycho.com/journal/jujutsu-megamerges-and-jj-absorb>
  - Keep a number of changes in your working copy and split changes as you make
    them into new 'parallel' commits.
  - Also: <https://ofcr.se/jujutsu-merge-workflow>
  - Create a new stream of work: `jj split -B merge -A master@upstream -i`
    - TODO: Can we do something clever with revsets here?
    - Move changes from your WIP commit to a new arm of the merge:
      `jj split -B merge -A master@upstream .`

# Gripes / issues to keep an eye on

## Conflicts

- Conflicts include lines with the same changes on both sides:
  <https://github.com/jj-vcs/jj/issues/7173>
- Conflict markers do not include the base contents:
  <https://github.com/jj-vcs/jj/issues/6021>
- Conflict markers do not include the revision each side is from:
  <https://github.com/jj-vcs/jj/issues/1176>

## Templates

- No easy way to list/format conflicted files:
  <https://github.com/jj-vcs/jj/issues/7377>
- No way to write comments in templates:
  <https://github.com/jj-vcs/jj/issues/5317>
- Whitespace is not allowed before method calls in templates, so you can't do
  the normal method chain syntax: <https://github.com/jj-vcs/jj/issues/7378>
