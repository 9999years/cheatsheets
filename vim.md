# vim

my workflow is missing:

- tools for having multiple "working directories" / "project directories"
- browsable marks. @lf- said she had something for this?

## nvim default binds

see: <https://github.com/neovim/neovim/blob/master/runtime/lua/vim/_defaults.lua>

- you can `gx` on a URL to open it in your browser (!)
